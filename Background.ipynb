    "Even though Portuguese universities have existed since 1290, by the end of 19th century the illiteracy rate was over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of population. 68.1 percent of Portugal's population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the 1960s, the country made public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, aiming to increase the literacy rate. However, education more than basic was not affordable for most Portuguese families. The country has applied many policies such as the School Food Support Programme, and the educational level has improved in the last decades. Still, the statistics keep Portugal at Europe's tail end due to its high student failure rates."

    "In Portugal, the secondary education consists of 3 years of schooling, preceding 9 years of basic education and followed by higher education. Most of the students join the public and free education system. Like several other countries (e.g. France and Venezuela), a 20-point grading scale is used, where 0 is the lowest grade and 20 is the perfect score. During the school year, students are evaluated in three periods and the last evaluation corresponds to the final grade."

    "The data we use were obtained in a survey of students from math and portuguese language courses in 2 secondary schools in Portugal. It was analyzed by Cortez and Silva to predict secondary school student performance. The database was built from two sources: school reports, based on paper sheets and including few attributes (i.e. the three period grades and number of absences); and questionnaires, used to complement the previous information. The latter was designed with closed questions with predefined options related to several demographic, social/emotional and school related variables that were expected to affect student performance. The final version contained 37 questions in a single A4 sheet and it was answered in class by 788 students. Later, 111 answers were discarded due to lack of identification details which were necessary for merging with the school reports. Finally, the data was integrated into two datasets related to Mathematics and the Portuguese language classes. Details for each variable in the dataset is listed below:"

However the effect of education is not constant across the conditional wage distribution. The effect is higher for those who have higher wage. Wage inequality expaned in Portugal over the 1980s and the returns to education had an important role in this process.\n",

Therefore, they conclude, influence of education is not as large as other studies showed."
